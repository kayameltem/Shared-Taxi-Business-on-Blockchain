# Shared-Taxi-Business-on-Blockchain
Imagine a group of people in the same neighborhood who would like to invest into an asset. A smart contract that handles a common asset and distribution of income generated from this asset in certain time intervals. The common asset in this scenario is a taxi. 

In this project you are asked to create a smart contract that handles a common asset and distribution of income
generated from this asset in certain time intervals. The common asset in this scenario is a taxi.
Imagine a group of people in the same neighborhood who would like to invest into an asset. They cannot invest
individually because each person has a very small amount of money, thus they can combine their holdings together
to invest into a bigger and more profitable investment.
They decided to combine their money and buy a car which will be used as a taxi and the profit will be shared
among participants every month. However, one problem is that they have no trust in each other.
To make this investment work, you are asked to write a smart contract that will handle the transactions. The
contract will run on Ethereum network.

The contract should **at least include** below. If you need to extend the state variables and functions, you are free to
do so as long as they are necessary. For function parameters try to write functions as few parameters as possible,
none preferred if possible.
For the functions that send and receive money, like join, purchasecar, sellcar, getchargei getsalary, carexpenses,
getdividend should send/transfer the amount to the address that it supposed to. you can keep a mapping for the
balance for individuals, and update the balances internally but when above functions called, you need to actually
send/receive money (ether/wei).

Keep a contract balance.
